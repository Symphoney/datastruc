# Restaurant Management
Data Structures Project, worked on by four authors including myself. This was a project for my data structures class. This requires Java 9 to run it. The <strong>wiki</strong> includes a document associated with this program. It helps with making the restaurant management quick and efficient, helpful for both management and customers.
